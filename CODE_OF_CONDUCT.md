# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in the Hacknetics project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to providing a welcoming and professional environment for all participants.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information (physical or electronic addresses) without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the GitHub repository, issue tracker, pull requests, discussions, and any other communication channels associated with Hacknetics. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Responsible Use

Hacknetics is an educational resource for penetration testing and red team operations. All techniques, tools, and information documented in this project are intended strictly for:

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue on the repository or contacting the project maintainers directly. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
