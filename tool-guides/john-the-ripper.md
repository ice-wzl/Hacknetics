## Format-Specific Cracking

Once you have identified the hash that you're dealing with, you can tell john to use it while cracking the provided hash using the following syntax:

```
john --format=[format] --wordlist=[path to wordlist] [path to file]
```

* This is the flag to tell John that you're giving it a hash of a specific format, and to use the following format to crack it
* `--format=`

### Example Usage:

```
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt
```

* A Note on Formats:
* When you are telling john to use formats, if you're dealing with a standard hash type, e.g. md5 as in the example above, you have to prefix it withraw- to tell john you're just dealing with a standard hash type, though this doesn't always apply.
* To check if you need to add the prefix or not, you can list all of John's formats using john --list=formats and either check manually, or grep for your hash type using something like

```
john --list=formats | grep -iF "md5".
```

## Cracking Windows Hashes

### NTHash and NTLM

* NThash is the hash format that modern Windows Operating System machines will store user and service passwords in.
* It's also commonly referred to as "NTLM" which references the previous version of Windows format for hashing passwords known as "LM", thus "NT/LM". -You can acquire NTHash/NTLM hashes by dumping the SAM database on a Windows machine.
* By using a tool like Mimikatz or from the Active Directory database: NTDS.dit.
* You may not have to crack the hash to continue privilege escalation- as you can often conduct a "pass the hash" attack instead, but sometimes hash cracking is a viable option if there is a weak password policy.

## Cracking Hashes on Linux

### Unshadowing

* John can be very particular about the formats it needs data in to be able to work with it, for this reason- in order to crack /etc/shadow passwords, you must combine it with the /etc/passwd file in order for John to understand the data it's being given. To do this, we use a tool built into the John suite of tools called unshadow. The basic syntax of unshadow is as follows:

```
unshadow [path to passwd] [path to shadow]
```

* `unshadow` - Invokes the unshadow tool
* `[path to passwd]` - The file that contains the copy of the /etc/passwd file you've taken from the target machine
* `[path to shadow]` - The file that contains the copy of the /etc/shadow file you've taken from the target machine

### Example Usage:

```
unshadow local_passwd local_shadow > unshadowed.txt
```

#### Note on the files

* When using unshadow, you can either use the entire /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow file- if you have them available, or you can use the relevant line from each, for example:
* FILE 1 - local\_passwd
* Contains the /etc/passwd line for the root user:

```
root:x:0:0::/root:/bin/bash
```

* FILE 2 - local\_shadow
* Contains the /etc/shadow line for the root user:

```
root:$6$2nwjN454g.dv4HN/$m9Z/r2xVfweYVkrr.v5Ft8Ws3/YYksfNwq96UL1FX0OJjY1L6l.DS3KEVsZ9rOVLB/ldTeEL/OIhJZ4GMFMGA0:18576::::::
```

### Cracking

* We're then able to feed the output from unshadow, in our example use case called "unshadowed.txt" directly into John.
* We should not need to specify a mode here as we have made the input specifically for John.
* However in some cases you will need to specify the format as we have done previously using: `--format=sha512crypt`.

```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=sha512crypt unshadowed.txt
```

## Cracking Zip Password Protected File

### Zip2John

* Similarly to the unshadow tool that we used previously, we're going to be using the zip2john tool to convert the zip file into a hash format that John is able to understand
* The basic usage is like this:

```
zip2john [options] [zip file] > [output file]
```

* `[options]` - Allows you to pass specific checksum options to zip2john, this shouldn't often be necessary
* `[zip file]` - The path to the zip file you wish to get the hash of
* `>` - This is the output director, we're using this to send the output from this file to the...
* `[output file]` - This is the file that will store the output from

#### Example Usage

```
zip2john zipfile.zip > zip_hash.txt
```

#### Cracking

* We're then able to take the file we output from zip2john in our example use case called "zip\_hash.txt" and, as we did with unshadow, feed it directly into John as we have made the input specifically for it.

```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt zip_hash.txt
```

## Cracking a Password Protected RAR Archive

### Rar2John

* Almost identical to the zip2john tool that we just used, we're going to use the rar2john tool to convert the rar file into a hash format that John is able to understand.
* The basic syntax is as follows:

```
rar2john [rar file] > [output file]
```

* `rar2john` - Invokes the rar2john tool
* `[rar file]` - The path to the rar file you wish to get the hash of
* `>` - This is the output director, we're using this to send the output from this file to the...
* `[output file]` - This is the file that will store the output from

#### Example Usage

```
rar2john rarfile.rar > rar_hash.txt
```

#### Cracking

* Once again, we're then able to take the file we output from rar2john in our example use case called "rar\_hash.txt" and, as we did with zip2john we can feed it directly into John..

```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rar_hash.txt
```

## Cracking SSH Keys

### SSH2John

* As the name suggests ssh2john converts the id\_rsa private key that you use to login to the SSH session into hash format that john can work with.
* Note that if you don't have ssh2john installed, you can use ssh2john.py, which is located in the `/opt/john/ssh2john.py`.
* If you're doing this, replace the ssh2john command with python3 /opt/ssh2john.py or on Kali, python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py.

```
ssh2john [id_rsa private key file] > [output file]
```

* `ssh2john` - Invokes the ssh2john tool
* `[id_rsa private key file]` - The path to the id\_rsa file you wish to get the hash of
* `>` - This is the output director, we're using this to send the output from this file to the...
* `[output file]` - This is the file that will store the output from

#### Example Usage

```
ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa_hash.txt
```

#### Cracking

* For the final time, we're feeding the file we output from ssh2john, which in our example use case is called "id\_rsa\_hash.txt" and, as we did with rar2john we can use this seamlessly with John:

```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt id_rsa_hash.txt
```

## PGP Keys

* Have a file `tryhackme.adc` (the PGP Private Key block) and `credential.pgp` (the encrypted file)
* Use `gpg2john` output the PGP key to a hash format

```
gpg2john tryhackme.asc > hash
```

* Should look like this:

```
tryhackme:$gpg$*17*54*3072*713ee3f57cc950f8f89155679abe2476c62bbd286ded0e049f886d32d2b9eb06f482e9770c710abc2903f1ed70af6fcc22f5608760be*3*254*2*9*16*0c99d5dae8216f2155ba2abfcc71f818*65536*c8f277d2faf97480:::tryhackme <stuxnet@tryhackme.com>::tryhackme.asc
```

* Crack the hash

```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash
john --format=gpg --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash
```

* Should end up with the file contents

```
tryhackme:alexandru:::tryhackme <stuxnet@tryhackme.com>::tryhackme.asc
```

* Now need to use gpg to import the key back on the target box

```
gpg --import tryhackme.asc
gpg --decrypt credential.pgp
```

### GPG Errors

```
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
```

* Errors populates despite it being the correct key -> Memory daemon needs restarting

```
ps aux | grep gpg-agent
kill -14 pid#
```

## Rule Based Attacks

* Also known as hybrid attacks.
* Assumes attacker knows something about the password policy.
* John config file:

```
/etc/john/john.conf
OR
/opt/john/john.conf
```

* Look for `List.Rules` to see the available rules.
* Example:

```
cat /etc/john/john.conf|grep "List.Rules:" | cut -d"." -f3 | cut -d":" -f2 | cut -d"]" -f1 | awk NF
JumboSingle
o1
o2
i1
i2
o1
i1
o2
i2
best64
d3ad0ne
dive
InsidePro
T0XlC
rockyou-30000
specific
```

* `best64` rule contains the best 64 built in `John` Rules.
* To use:

```
echo "tryhackme" > single-password-list.txt
john --wordlist=/tmp/single-password-list.txt --rules=best64 --stdout | wc -l
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
76p 0:00:00:00 100.00% (2021-10-11 13:42) 1266p/s pordpo
76
```

* \--wordlist= to specify the wordlist or dictionary file.
* \--rules to specify which rule or rules to use.
* \--stdout to print the output to the terminal.
* |wc -l to count how many lines John produced.
* By running the previous command we have expanded our password list from 1 (tryhackme) to 76.

#### Another Good Rule to use:

```
john --wordlist=single-password-list.txt --rules=KoreLogic --stdout |grep "Tryh@ckm3"
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
Tryh@ckm3
7089833p 0:00:00:02 100.00% (2021-10-11 13:56) 3016Kp/s tryhackme999999
```

### Creating Custom Rules

* we want to add special characters to the beginning and a number to the end, the format would be:

```
[symbols]word[0-9]
```

* We can add our rule to the end of john.conf:

```
user@machine$ sudo vi /etc/john/john.conf 
[List.Rules:THM-Password-Attacks] 
Az"[0-9]" ^[!@#$]
```

\[List.Rules:THM-Password-Attacks] specify the rule name THM-Password-Attacks.

* `Az` represents a single word from the original wordlist/dictionary using `-p`.
* `"[0-9]"` append a single digit (from 0 to 9) to the end of the word. For two digits, we can add `"[0-9][0-9]"` and so on.
* `^[!@#$]` add a special character at the beginning of each word. `^` means the beginning of the line/word. Note, changing `^` to `$` will append the special characters to the end of the line/word.
